## 1. 💌 Valentine Quest

**The Ultimate Digital Valentine Experience**

### **[👉 PLAY QUEST LIVE 👈](https://riddhi-lac.vercel.app)**

### ✨ About

**Valentine Quest** is a fun, interactive, retro-themed digital experience designed to pop the big question in style. Built with a nostalgic Windows 95/98 aesthetic, it takes the user on a playful journey through various "security checks" before delivering the final message.

### 🚀 Features

- **Retro Aesthetic**: Custom-styled windows, buttons, and layouts mimicking classic OS interfaces.
- **Runaway "No" Button**: The "No" button mischievously evades the cursor.
- **Interactive "Security" Checks**: quirky Captcha systems and fake loading screens.
- **Dynamic Desktop**: Clickable desktop icons like "Love_Letter.txt".

## 2. 🧾 Valentine 2: The Subscription

**A Brutalist "Official Renewal" Notice**

### **[👉 RENEW SUBSCRIPTION LIVE 👈](https://mehak-five.vercel.app/)**

### ✨ About

A hilarious, "official" subscription renewal experience. The user is presented with a relationship invoice they must accept—trying to cancel only leads to "traps" and bureaucratic hurdles, ensuring the only way out is saying YES to the "meetup".

### 🚀 Features

- **Brutalist Design**: Stark pink & black theme with `Space Mono` typography and hard shadows.
- **Bureaucracy Simulator**: Fake invoices, playful "Cancel" traps, and mandatory form filing.
- **Support Chatbot**: A persistent "Agent" that ensures compliance.
- **Celebration Mode**: Confetti and a "Transaction Approved" receipt.
